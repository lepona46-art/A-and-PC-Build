# A-and-PC-Build
I am creating a personal portfolio blog to document my PC build project while studying the CompTIA A+ key tasks, knowledge's, and skills. The goal is to use GitHub Pages to host and update my HTML site blog so I can showcase my technical learning and hands-on experience. Please visit https://lepona46-art.github.io/A-and-PC-Build/ to access the blog.
