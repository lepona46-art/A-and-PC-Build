    <p>Hello! My name is Aubrie, and this portfolio documents my 8-month journey to earning the CompTIA A+ certification by planning, building, and optimizing a custom PC. This project is both a showcase of technical skills and an example of applying A+ exam knowledge to real-world IT work.</p>

    <h2>Build Log</h2>
    <p>Below is a week-by-week record of my progress, including photos, tasks completed, and lessons learned.</p>
    <p><em>(Replace placeholder text with your updates)</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Week 1-3:</strong> WK 1-2: Setting up blog in HTML and creating a GitHub repository- Thank goodness I decided to start learning Python a few weeks ago (´꒳`)♡ because it actually came in handy when I used ChatGPT v5.0 to generate the HTML for this blog. Some might say I took the “lazy” way out, but honestly, I’d argue it’s just using my resources wisely—after all, I don’t have an old-school coder hiding in my closet to double-check my work. Coming from a cybersecurity background, coding isn’t my strongest skill, but I know I need to start somewhere, especially if I want a tangible project that shows the effort I’m putting in. The little bits of Python I’ve been practicing (just 15–20 minutes a day on weekdays) surprisingly helped me recognize the logic in HTML, even though I’d never touched it before. The result? My blog is officially up and running, and I even managed to set up a GitHub repository—though I’ll admit it took a fair amount of troubleshooting before the structure and workflow finally clicked. Honeslty, mistakes are the best learning tool because it means you are doing and trying. And in the end, it’s working, I’m excited to keep building and move on to the next step.
</li>
        <li><strong>Week 4-6:</strong> A+ Mike Meyers Videos - Using the resource, LinkedIn Learning, I was able to access the videos and have been watching when I can almost like a podcast. They are great foundational knowledge to add to the tool bag as I was a career shift into cyber being exposed to a ransomware attack to the school district I was teaching at. However, acronyms hit again. Acronyms soup is so good in the cyber and computer world there are even the same acronyms and unless an average person is using them daily, how do they remember them? Back to the old practice of flash cards and do some drilling to get the key ones taken care of. I like how most tips for the troubleshooting process are READ! Be literate and read the manual guides because who is going to remember that anyways (and if you do, you are gifted or have a lot of practical experience). It reminds me of my favorite quiz to give to students to teach them to read and not assume, a quiz with the directions of “Do not take this quiz. To score a 100 percent, put your name and flip the test over.” That simple action was enough to get the students to read and think before they do action. I feel the same about hardware, reading and research to ensure capabilities, compatibility, and if there is a problem, document and test each hypothesis before moving on to the next one. To quote Percule Haoirot  in The Murder on the Links “My friend, I am a man of method. Order and method, they are everything. Without them, nothing can be achieved.” Always start with the easy reason why the problem is happening, check connections to ensure connections are made and power/info is flowing, then check for the hard to find information to test for. Now to study and practice.
